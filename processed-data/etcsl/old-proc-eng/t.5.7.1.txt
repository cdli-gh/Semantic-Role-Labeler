t.5.7.1	 Enlil and Nam-zid-tara		1-10	Nam-zid-tara walked by Enlil, who said to him: Where have you come from, Nam-zid-tara? From Enlil's temple. My turn of duty is finished. I serve at the place of the gudug priests, with their sheep. I am on my way home. Don't stop me; I am in a hurry. Who are you who asks me questions?
t.5.7.1	 Enlil and Nam-zid-tara		11-16	I am Enlil. But Enlil had changed his appearance: he had turned into a raven and was croaking. But you are not a raven, you really are Enlil! How did you recognise that I am Enlil, who decrees the destinies?
t.5.7.1	 Enlil and Nam-zid-tara		17-18	When your uncle En-me-Å¡ara was a captive, after taking for himself the rank of Enlil, he said: Now I shall know the fates, like a lord.
t.5.7.1	 Enlil and Nam-zid-tara		19-23	You may acquire precious metals, you may acquire precious stones, you may acquire cattle or you may acquire sheep; but the day of a human being is always getting closer, so where does your wealth lead? Now, I am indeed Enlil, who decrees the fates. What is your name?
t.5.7.1	 Enlil and Nam-zid-tara		24-27	My name is Nam-zid-tara (Well-blessed). Your fate shall be assigned according to your name: leave the house of your master, and your heirs shall come and go regularly in my temple.
