XX beloved sister of Dumuzid, beloved XX of Durtur, XX seed implanted into the womb by a good bull, my lady, born to ladyship! With her aid the cattle-pen was filled with butter and cream, with her aid the sheepfold was long provided with milk. On the high plain, my XX, you are Ŋeštin-ana. O girl, XX indeed! Your little ones XX indeed! Unug XX indeed! Kulaba XX indeed! XX you are XX.
Because of her brother, the girl lacerated her eyes and lacerated her mouth; she lacerated her buttocks, the place not spoken of to men. She made her way towards the tavern of the palace. The girl questioned a minister who was coming out of the palace.
The minister who was coming out of the palace answered the girl: Those endowed with divine powers, 10 incantation priests, prostration priests, bathed priests and ablution priests will never cease coming every month, once a month, to the great shrine, for (?) your brother, who has taken possession of the en priesthood, the en priesthood of Unug XX, for (?) your brother, who has taken possession of the en priesthood.
At that time there were seven, there were seven, the song performers of Unug were seven; in Zabalam the lament singers were fifty. They knew the stars of the heavens, and they knew the roads of the earth. In the broad heavens, they carried the first-fruit offerings. They raised songs, and they lowered songs; they did not declare the beginning of the song to them. They were elders not yet assigned to their positions.
The little sister dwelling among them spoke to them  While we raise the song, you will lower the song. XX she did not dwell among them XX. She dwelt in the XX of the eršema (?). She dwelt XX the eršema (?), of precious metal and lapis lazuli, of the goldsmith.
