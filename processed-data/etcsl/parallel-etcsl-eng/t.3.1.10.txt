Say to Puzur-Šulgi, commander of the fortress Igi-hursaŋa: this is what Šulgi, your lord, says:
Where  1 ms. has instead: when  I had built the great fortress Igi-hursaŋa, the XX not come out. The XX cannot drink water,  because of a breach (?) in (?) the Tigris and Euphrates  1 ms. has instead: XX together with the Euphrates .
In order that XX should lie down, in order that XX should be absolutely clean, in order that XX should be put (?) XX,
I will make XX change XX. After sending you back XX, I (?) instructed you XX. I (?) have built there (?) XX. They returned (?) XX.
May XX be taken up. May he rebuild XX.
XX is sending to me XX. I will ask you (?) XX. XX of Zimudar shall indeed come to you XX.  XX was taken (?).
XX be sent. I (?) know very well XX. XX abandon you (?). Should XX take XX, you both XX. It is urgent!
