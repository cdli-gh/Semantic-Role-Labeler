XX raised his head high. XX before him XX rejoiced at him. XX embraced him. Your XX has determined the destiny. May you be their XX, exercising lordship over them. May XX which has been bestowed on you never cease. You are well-suited for XX, and may its time be prolonged for you. A destiny has been determined for you and you have been called by name; may you have no rival!
