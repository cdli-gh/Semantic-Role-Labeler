My hair is lettuce, well watered. It is the sprout of a lettuce, well watered. Its tangled coils (?) have been tightened. My nursemaid has XX them high and made my hair stag-like. She has tightened its tiny hairgrips and brought order to my charms; my charms, my hair, the lettuce, is the fairest of plants.
The brother has brought me into his life-giving gaze, Šu-Suen, the XX handsome man, has chosen me. XX my allure is without end,
You are our lord, you are our lord, of silver and lapis lazuli, you are our lord. You are our farmer who brings superb grain.
He is honey to my eyes, he is the charm of my heart. May the light of life shine for him, may Šu-Suen XX.
