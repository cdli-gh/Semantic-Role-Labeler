Speak to my god: this is what Gudea, your servant, says:
I am like a sheep who has no reliable shepherd; there is no reliable herdsman to lead me on.
An unintelligent merchant transported me (?) for trading purposes. With a vicious whip he XX me cruelly like a donkey.
I am noble (?) but do not utter a word, being vigilantly (?) XX. Seven times XX has not XX my accomplishments. Seven times my god (?) has not been able to find out about their extent.
