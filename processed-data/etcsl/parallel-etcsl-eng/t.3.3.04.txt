Say to the governor and temple administrator what Ur-Enlila says:
The irrigation ditch which has been cleared was bringing water but Enlil-diŋirŋu  1 ms. has instead: Enlil-aŋu  another ms. has instead: Enlilaŋu   and Hanzamu have drawn off the water and taken it from the ditch.
I proposed,  Water should be brought  1 ms. has instead: The irrigation should be done   on the basis of one ditch for me, one ditch for you and one ditch for the governor, but they did not agree. Your canal has no workers but its ditch brings water. It brings water for me unchecked. My workforce is inadequate so send me five or 10  1 ms. has instead: 60   able-bodied men. It is urgent.
