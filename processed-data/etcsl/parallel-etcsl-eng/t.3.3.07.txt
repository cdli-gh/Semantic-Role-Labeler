Traveller, traveller, say to my mother what Ugubi says:
Urim is the joyful city of Nanna. But I sit behind the door of the chief musician's house in Eridug, the abundant city of Enki. Longing consumes me. I don't want to die because the bread is never fresh and the beer is never fresh. Send a messenger to me at once. It is urgent.
