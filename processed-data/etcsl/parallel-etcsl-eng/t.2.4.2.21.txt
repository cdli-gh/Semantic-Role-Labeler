Nergal who XX, XX great awe, who XX the underworld -- its awesome radiance XX the battle-net, its awesomeness has filled heaven and earth.
Hero, wild bull with thick horns, XX like a cow, your terrifying name lets loose awe and fear. You fall on the rebel lands like the south wind. You are a bolt on the broad extent of the mountains. When you sit in E-mešlam, your desires are joyously fulfilled (?). The people assemble at your feet.
Mešlamta-ea, your supremacy in the rebel lands! You have encircled the rebel lands, O youth. Nergal, your supremacy in the rebel lands!
Your father loves you greatly. He has made your heroism known among the people. Your father Enlil loves you greatly. He has made your heroism known among the people.
Hero XX for the people, god roaming the mountains! You have XX the rebel lands. Nergal XX for the people, god roaming the mountains!
Wherever you stride, all their troops suffer. XX Anšan and Tidnum, Nergal, wherever you stride, all their troops suffer.
May you prolong the life of the hero Šulgi. XX to his strength, XX.
