He is a good seed of a dog, the offspring of a wolf! He is the stench of a mongoose, an unruly (?) hyena cub, a fox with a covering like a crab's, a monkey not pleasing to its homeland, its judgment confused. His face is disfigured, his judgment is muddled, his intelligence is XX. I would XX with the dog (?), a smitten man who makes himself important. He is negligent, a cripple, the son of a hound. A madman, crazy, a man who XX -- he is a pitfall, XX evil words, denouncing XX with an evil mouth and a forked tongue.
XX, he lies on the bank of a river, allowing the grappling-poles (?) to drown. XX a silent house, XX an open hand (?), he is a thief, breaking into houses, removing (?) the door and tearing out the door pivot. One who daily spreads evil talk among his clan, XX not entering the house of another man, he sets up XX and signs (?) for him and XX him altogether. XX, he quarrels with him and disturbs his household. XX their advice is not good for him nor is their XX favourable for him. He prepares XX for him and XX. He gave XX and ran (?) XX. Loving XX, he never calms a heated quarrel.
A XX man bringing complaints XX. He is a bastard (?), XX. He does not XX -- may he follow an unfamiliar path! May he XX and walk among the thorns of the mountains! XX he does not come out XX. He XX and grasps wickedly XX. He crushes XX and sweeps over XX. Fit for his XX and judgment, XX in his advice, XX, loving XX, a snake-charmer, may he XX and not act with evil intent.
