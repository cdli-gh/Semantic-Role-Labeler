Say to Šarrum-bāni: this is what Šu-Suen, your lord, says:
The messenger whom you have sent to me XX. XX you do not exceed XX my instructions, as I ordered you.  As for myself, whatever you say to me XX.
When you went into the province -- who but you (?) has approached the province? Spending the night XX. When their dignitaries have XX their words, if XX  Their dignitaries should stand by you in (?) their quarters. When their XX have been cast away, they themselves XX the province.
If XX officials should pass by (?),  By (?) placing the enemy, their cities, their borders XX, until  they come down  1 ms. has instead: they come out from their fortress , they must not overturn it!
When their men had killed,  their women  1 ms. has instead: their soldiers  passed (?) through your cities of the province; it was not XX.
That was how I instructed you. Why did you not act as I ordered you?
You were not empowered to kill anyone, to blind (?) people or to destroy cities; but I gave you authority to do so.
When my father Šulgi built the fortress XX, it was not you people who were involved -- and my throne is not the throne of Šulgi!
Concerning Lu-Enki, the ruler of the province of Zimudar, he should come to you, and should bring with him 60 troops. Let them be sent together with XX.
XX, the archivist, made XX limited (?). According to the instructions that have been given to him, he should build that fortress.
And as for you, with the soldiers who are under your authority, get the trench dug!
So as not to change the attitude of the province, you people are not to release the workers while the land has not yet been secured.
Let messengers bring me news about those eastern provinces. This is urgent!
