Say to my lord: this is what Arad≈ãu, your servant, says:
Aba-indasa, the captain of the royal pledged troops, has sent you XX. May my lord take note most carefully concerning this matter.
When I had set my sights towards Zimudar, I was levying troops for the expedition, my lord; but when Aba-indasa had inspected the troops, 2000 men of those troops were missing. They were not XX, nor XX. They have XX the fortress, my lord, they have taken XX.
XX offence XX.  Whatever you say, my lord! May my lord know!
