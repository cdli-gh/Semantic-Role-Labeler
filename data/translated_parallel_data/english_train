life

crown and tiara ,

the throne of kingship
with a secure foundation ,
years of abundance ,
a flood of weapons
which cast forth great fearsomeness ,

in those wars and battles
he was repeatedly victorious .
Their head warriors

Their runners

Their strong and weak
he killed like dogs .
The heads of their righteous and treacherous ones

he did …
The young men
who from the grasp of battle
had fallen out ,
and to their cities
like  birds had saved their lives ,
did not escape his hand .
Towards their cities
like an Anzu-eagle he himself
screeched .
Their settled cities and towns
he made into ruined mounds ,
and their walls
he demolished .
The young men of their cities
which he had conquered
he removed their eyes ,
and in the orchards of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
in the orchards of the great gods
he made them into domestic servants .
Further , the young women
of those cities
which he had conquered
in the weaving-houses
of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
he offered as gifts .
Their cattle , sheep , goats and donkeys
which he brought in
and in the temples of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
he sacrificed them .
Gold and silver
and things fashioned
into big sacks

with an offering kid ,
were made in miniature ,
and , set up for  my prayers ,
as the main courtyard of the Gagiššua's
ornament , I fashioned for her ,
and for my life
I dedicated them to her .
A person who an order of wickedness
shall issue against it ,
and my creation
shall efface ,
by the exalted command of Enlil
… may his revealed name
be revoked from within the Ekur .
May Ninurta , the mighty warrior of Enlil ,
be the inseparable bailiff for this
for an eternity of days!
