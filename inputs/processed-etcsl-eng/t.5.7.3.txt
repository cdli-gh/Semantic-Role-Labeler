t.5.7.3	An axe for Nergal		1-9	Nibruta-lu, the son of the merchant Lugal-Å¡uba, has had this tin axe made for Nergal. Its wooden part is of arganum tree of the mountains, a wood which is superior even to the alal stone; its stone part is of antasura, a stone which has no equal. The arm of the man who strikes with it will never get tired.
t.5.7.3	An axe for Nergal		10-16	Should it break, I will repair it for Nergal. Should it disappear, I will replace it for him. May Nergal look after me during my life, and may he provide me with clean water in the underworld after my death.
