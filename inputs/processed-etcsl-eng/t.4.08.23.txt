May my sheep eat my XX which is growing in the fields, my plants, my camel-thorn. May my sheep eat my XX, my plants, my winnowed barley. May my sheep eat my life of the Land which is growing in the fields, my plants, my stubble. May my sheep eat my support of orphans and sustenance of widows, my plants, my Å¡akir plants. May my sheep eat my string of clay balls (?) which is growing in the fields, my plants, my colocynth. May my sheep eat my beer wort mixed with honey, my plants, my marsh reeds. May my sheep eat my calves going together with their bulls, my plants, my reed shoots. May my sheep eat my blossoming garden of apple trees, my plants, my reeds.

May my sheep eat my XX waterskin hanging from the saddle, my plants, my harub pods. May my sheep eat my grass spread out like a mantle, my plants, my meadow grass. May my sheep eat my native-born (?) of flourishing Sumer, my plants, my kali plants. May my sheep eat my unkempt long hair, my plants, my esparto grass. May my sheep eat my plants that ignore winter and summer, my plants, my date palm saplings. May my sheep eat my beautiful XX plants with a head of fine hairs, my plants, my lilangi plants. May my sheep eat my XX growing in the desert, my plants, my apple grass.
