t.4.08.32	A song of Inana and Dumuzid (Dumuzid-Inana F1)		1-10	XX my side. XX on a bed dripping with honey. XX his hand in my hand. XX his foot by my foot. XX my lips on his mouth.

XX like a bracelet on my hand. XX lapis lazuli on my neck. XX like silver XX of my bridegroom.
t.4.08.32	A song of Inana and Dumuzid (Dumuzid-Inana F1)		11-15	The brother XX in his garden. XX stand XX his standing tree. XX lie down XX his recumbent tree. He laid me down XX. XX dates.
t.4.08.32	A song of Inana and Dumuzid (Dumuzid-Inana F1)		16-23	The XX spoke to me among the apple trees. My precious sweet XX my head. The XX spoke to me among the fig trees. My precious sweet XX my XX. The XX spoke to me among the willow (?) trees. My precious sweet XX. The XX spoke to me XX. My precious sweet XX my XX.
