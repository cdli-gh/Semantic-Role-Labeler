Say to Aradŋu: This is what your lord Šulgi says:
Because Aba-indasa, the captain of the pledged troops, had sent a letter concerning XX, he (?) indeed insisted on clamping down heavily, when you have borne (?) the offence. Why do they (?) let him rise up from among their troops and make him enter XX of my guard? Carry (?) it (?), and have your heart bear (?) the offence, XX the enemy has departed, and then return him to (?) their troops!
From my own XX, XX the fortress XX.  I had set up XX. XX the fortress XX, you knew (?) XX. XX sending my letter by his hand (?), XX return him (?) to their troops!
XX when you have made good by appointing (?) XX, XX you XX ruin XX! XX was set, it was XX for you. In a safe place where XX before you, you should take your seat on a throne. This is urgent!
XX Ur-Namma, my own father, XX the fortress XX. XX I have set up for their XX. From XX the fortress XX. After XX my letter, return XX to their troops!
May XX not ruin their city! Its pride XX for their troops. XX, may you XX on a throne.
