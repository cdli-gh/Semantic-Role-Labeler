Speak to my lord: this is what Nanna-ki-aŋ the general, your servant, says:
E-danna has turned against my lord. Atta-mannum has made six hundred troops of Gungunum enter into E-danna.
I would not allow these troops to enter old Iri-saŋ-ana. They camped instead in Iri-gibil.  These troops  1 ms. has instead: The troops of Gungunum  have come from the banks of the Id-Amar-Suena watercourse, in order to build XX, to make Dunnum ready (?) and to XX.
If my lord does not XX crews of highlanders, bows, arrows, small boats, fishermen XX, their tied-up leather sacks, weapons, XX and implements, the armaments of battle, then the troops will construct brick structures by the bank of the Id-Amar-Suena watercourse, XX and dig a XX canal.
They should not be neglectful, my lord! It is urgent!
