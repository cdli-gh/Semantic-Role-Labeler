Say to my lord: this is what the merchant Ur-DUN, your servant, says:
My lord gave me silver and sent me to a distant land in order to purchase cedar resin. After I had entered the land and had purchased cedar resin, Apillaša, the 'Sage of the Assembly', sent men to me and they took away my goods.
When I arrived at his palace gate, no one enquired about my business. Aradŋu, your servant, and Babati, the archivist, had gone from Zimudar to Simurrum and had learnt XX and their messengers XX.
XX of my lord XX. Being in a weak (?) position, I was not able to XX their illegal seizure.
He has given you a report, lord. Whatever you say, my lord!
