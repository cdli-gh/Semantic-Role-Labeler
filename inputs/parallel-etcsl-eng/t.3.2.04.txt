Say to Nanna-ki-aŋ, the general: this is what Lipit-Eštar, your lord, says:
Because of  enemy troops  1 ms. has instead: the enemy ,  I, the king, have sent you a letter  1 ms. has instead: I have sent a letter . Atta-mannum, who pleases his lord, is (?) a better  servant to his lord  1 ms. has instead: man  than you! Why is it that  you have not been avenging your lord, and not keeping me informed  1 ms. has instead: while I (?) have kept the soldiers loyal (?), you have not stationed them among those people ?  1 ms. adds: So now you are to station the troops there.
Now,  I have sent to you in haste  1 ms. has instead: they have pursued (?)   2000  1 ms. has instead: 4000  1 other ms. has instead: 3000  soldiers  who are spear-throwers   1 ms. has instead: who are XX spear-throwers ,  2000  1 ms. has instead: 4000  soldiers  who are archers  1 ms. has instead: who are XX archers , and  2000  1 ms. has instead: 1000  soldiers  who are double-axe wielders  1 ms. has instead: who are XX double-axe wielders .
The enemy has camped down in Iri-gibil. Chase them away from those settlements; do not XX. Guard (?) each city XX. Do not let these cities out of your grasp. Station your people -- it is urgent!
