O An, strengthen the foundations of the throne of life. Rīm-Sîn, may your name be called by a name of life; may he look upon you with favourable eyes, and pay attention to you.  May he determine a destiny of life as a fate for you. Rīm-Sîn, may you be beloved of An, and may your kingship endure forever. Great An, make him shepherd of the numerous people.
