Enlil lifted his glance over all the lands, and the lands raised themselves to Enlil. The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden. Keš was positioned there for him with head uplifted, and as Keš lifted its head among all the lands, Enlil spoke in praise of Keš.
Nisaba was its decision-maker (?); with its words she wove it intricately like a net. Written on tablets it was held in her hands: House, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! House Keš, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! Growing as high as the hills, embracing the heavens, growing as high as E-kur, lifting its head among the mountains!  Rooted in the abzu  2 mss. have instead: Colourful as the abzu , verdant like the mountains! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš?

House, 10 šar at its upper end, five šar at its lower end; house, 10 bur at its upper end, five bur at its lower end! House, at its upper end a bison, at its lower end a stag; house, at its upper end a wild sheep, at its lower end a deer; house, at its upper end a dappled wild sheep, at its lower end a beautiful deer! House, at its upper end green as a snake-eater bird, at its lower end floating on the water like a pelican! House, at its upper end rising like the sun, at its lower end spreading like the moonlight; house, at its upper end a warrior mace, at its lower end a battle-axe; house, at its upper end a mountain, at its lower end a spring! House, at its upper end threefold indeed! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
It is indeed a city, it is indeed a city! Who knows its interior? The house Keš is indeed a city! Who knows its interior? The heroes make their way straight into its interior and perform its oracle rites perfectly. Frisking cattle are gathered at the house in herds. The house consumes many cattle; the house consumes many sheep.  Those who sit on daises bow their necks before it.

House given birth by a lion, whose interior the hero has embellished (?)! House Keš, given birth by a lion, whose interior the hero has embellished (?)! The heroes make their way straight into its interior. Ninhursaŋa sits within like a great dragon. Nintur the great mother assists at births there. Šul-pa-e the ruler acts as lord. Ašgi the hero consumes the contents of the vessels (?). Urumaš, the great herald of the plains, dwells there too. Stags are gathered at the house in herds. Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
House positioned over its foundations like a storm, like white bulls standing about on the plain; house founded by the prince, in praise on the tigi instrument! House in whose interior is the power of the Land, and behind which  is the life of Sumer  some mss. have instead: it is filled with life ; at whose gate is a lion reclining on its paws, at whose gate is the ruler who decides cases (?)!

Whose well-founded storehouse is a corner of heaven, a corner of earth  1 ms. has here instead: Whose storehouse established as a household is a lance (?) ; whose terrace is supported by lahama deities; whose princely  1 ms. adds: great  wall XX the shrine of Urim!

The holy house whose XX is the shrine, the holy house Keš, whose XX is the shrine; the house whose lords are the Anuna gods, whose nueš priests are the sacrificers of E-ana! In the house the king places stone bowls in position; the good en priest XX holds the lead-rope dangling. The a-tu priest holds the staff; the XX brings the gathered (?) waters. The XX takes his seat in the holy place; the enkum priests bow down XX. The pašeš priests beat the drumskins; they recite powerfully, powerfully.

The singer  cries out  1 ms. has instead: declaims  to the ala drum;  the grand sweet tigi is played for him  some mss. have instead: the sweet tigi is well tuned . The house is built; its nobility is good! The house Keš is built; its nobility is good! Its lady has taken a seat in its XX. Ninhursaŋa, its lady, has taken her seat in its XX. Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
Draw near, man, to the city, to the city -- but do not draw near! Draw near, man, to the house Keš, to the city -- but do not draw near! Draw near, man, to its hero Ašgi -- but do not draw near! Draw near, man, to its lady Nintur -- but do not draw near! Praise be to well-built Keš, O Ašgi! Praise be to cherished Keš and Nintur!
